#### Description

Hi! I am Soumyadeb Batabyal and This my final poject for CS50. A web app called Weather App. This is actually a Node.js web application that allows users to get the current weather and 5-day forecast for a specific city. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data and displays it in a user-friendly format using HTML, CSS, and EJS templating engine.

The front-end of the app is built using HTML and CSS. It has a simple form that takes a city name as input and a submit button to fetch the weather data for that city. The app displays the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icon. It also displays a 5-day weather forecast, including the day of the week, weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

The back-end of the app is built using Node.js and the Express framework. It uses the request library to fetch the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The app parses the weather data and extracts the required information, such as the current weather conditions and the 5-day forecast. The app then renders the data using the EJS templating engine and sends it to the client as an HTML page.

The app has error handling in place to handle cases where the user enters an invalid city name or if there is an error in fetching the weather data. The app displays an error message in such cases and prompts the user to try again.

Overall, this is a simple yet useful web application that allows users to get the weather forecast for any city in the world.
